            Welcome to Plonk, a minimalistic dice roller!<br />
            <br />
            You can type any text you want in here. Anything within brackets is considered to be a dice formula. For instance: [2d20 + 1]. Click on a formula to roll it! After editing the text, press tab or click outside the box to process it.<br />
            <br />
            There are no saving facilities, so you should probably prepare the text in another editor!<br />
            <br />
            The notations "dX" and "XdY" are recognized, as well as all basic arithmetic operations:<br />
            <br />
            Just a [d6].<br />
            With a modifier [d10 + 3].<br />
            Multiple dice are added together: [4d6 + 10].<br />
            You can go as crazy as you like! [(3d6 * 5) + (4 + d4) * 3].<br />
            Use "//" for integer division, rounded down: [3d10 // 2].<br />
            <br />
            That's about it!
